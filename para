the lobund institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928 . this area of research originated in a question posed by pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria . though others had taken up this idea , their research was short lived and inconclusive . lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively , that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations . but the objective was not merely to answer pasteur 's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research . this objective was reached and for years lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations . today the work has spread to other universities . in the beginning it was under the department of biology and a program leading to the master 's degree accompanied the research program . in the 1940s lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an institute . in 1958 it was brought back into the department of biology as integral part of that department , but with its own program leading to the degree of phd in gnotobiotics .
